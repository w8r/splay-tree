# Fast splay tree [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/splaytree.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/splaytree) [![build](https://travis-ci.org/w8r/splay-tree.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/w8r/splay-tree) ![deps](https://david-dm.org/w8r/splay-tree/status.svg) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/w8r/splay-tree/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/w8r/splay-tree)

[Splay-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splay_tree): **[fast](#benchmarks)**(non-recursive) and **simple**(< 1000 lines of code)
Implementation is adapted directly from Wikipedia with the same API as [w8r/avl](https://github.com/w8r/avl), to run the benchmarks against other trees.


This tree is based on **top-down** splaying algorithm by D.Sleator. It supports
 - splitting, merging
 - updating of the keys
 - bulk loading of the items into an empty or non-empty tree
 - insertion with duplicates or no duplicates
 - lookup without splaying

## Install

```shell
npm i -S splaytree
```

```js
import SplayTree from 'splaytree';

```

Or get it from CDN
```html

  var tree = new SplayTree();
  ...
</script>
```
Or use the compiled version 'dist/splay.js'.

## API

* `new SplayTree([comparator])`, where `comparator` is optional comparison function
* `tree.insert(key:any, [data:any]):Node` - Insert item, allow duplicate keys
* `tree.add(key:any, [data:any]):Node` - Insert item if it is not present
* `tree.remove(key:any)` - Remove item
* `tree.find(key):Node|Null` - Return node by its key
* `tree.findStatic(key):Node|Null` - Return node by its key (doesn't re-balance the tree)
* `tree.at(index:Number):Node|Null` - Return node by its index in sorted order of keys
* `tree.contains(key):Boolean` - Whether a node with the given key is in the tree
* `tree.forEach(function(node) {...}):Tree` In-order traversal
* `tree.keys():Array<key>` - Returns the array of keys in order
* `tree.values():Array<*>` - Returns the array of data fields in order
* `tree.range(lo, high, function(node) {} [, context]):Tree` - Walks the range of keys in order. Stops, if the visitor function returns a non-zero value.
* `tree.pop():Node` - Removes smallest node
* `tree.min():key` - Returns min key
* `tree.max():key` - Returns max key
* `tree.minNode():Node` - Returns the node with smallest key
* `tree.maxNode():Node` - Returns the node with highest key
* `tree.prev(node):Node` - Predecessor node
* `tree.next(node):Node` - Successor node
* `tree.load(keys:Array<*>, [values:Array<*>][,presort=false]):Tree` - Bulk-load items. It expects values and keys to be sorted, but if `presort` is `true`, it will sort keys and values using the comparator(in-place, your arrays are going to be altered).

**Comparator**

`function(a:key,b:key):Number` - Comparator function between two keys, it returns
 * `0` if the keys are equal
 * `<0` if `a < b`
 * `>0` if `a > b`

 The comparator function is extremely important, in case of errors you might end
 up with a wrongly constructed tree or would not be able to retrieve your items.
 It is crucial to test the return values of your `comparator(a,b)` and `comparator(b,a)`
 to make sure it's working correctly, otherwise you may have bugs that are very
 unpredictable and hard to catch.

 **Duplicate keys**

* `insert()` method allows duplicate keys. This can be useful in certain applications (example: overlapping
 points in 2D).
* `add()` method will not allow duplicate keys - if key is already present in the tree, no new node is created

## Example

```js
import Tree from 'splaytree';

const t = new Tree();
t.insert(5);
t.insert(-10);
t.insert(0);
t.insert(33);
t.insert(2);

console.log(t.keys()); // [-10, 0, 2, 5, 33]
console.log(t.size);   // 5
console.log(t.min());  // -10
console.log(t.max());  // -33

t.remove(0);
console.log(t.size);   // 4
```

**Custom comparator (reverse sort)**

```js
import Tree from 'splaytree';

const t = new Tree((a, b) => b - a);
t.insert(5);
t.insert(-10);
t.insert(0);
t.insert(33);
t.insert(2);

console.log(t.keys()); // [33, 5, 2, 0, -10]
```

**Bulk insert**

```js
import Tree from 'splaytree';

const t = new Tree();
t.load([3,2,-10,20], ['C', 'B', 'A', 'D']);
console.log(t.keys());   // [-10, 2, 3, 20]
console.log(t.values()); // ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
```

- Fastest is 1 by 1
```

Adding google closure library to the benchmark is, of course, unfair, cause the
node.js version of it is not optimized by the compiler, but in this case it
plays the role of straight-forward robust implementation.

## Develop

```shell
npm i
npm t
npm run build
```

## TODO

- [ ] try and add parent fields for efficient `.prev()` and `.next()`, or iterators
